# Traefik noop

This plugin can be used to send response without the request to servers. The response code can be configured.

### Configuration

For each plugin, the Traefik static configuration must define the module name (as is usual for Go packages).

The following declaration (given here in YAML) defines a plugin:

```yaml
# Static configuration

experimental:
  plugins:
    noop:
      moduleName: github.com/traefik-contrib/noop
      version: v0.0.1
```

Here is an example of a file provider dynamic configuration (given here in YAML), where the interesting part is the `http.middlewares` section:

```yaml
# Dynamic configuration

http:
  routers:
    my-router:
      rule: host(`demo.localhost`)
      service: service-foo
      entryPoints:
        - web
      middlewares:
        - my-plugin

  services:
   service-foo:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://127.0.0.1:5000
  
  middlewares:
    my-plugin:
      plugin:
        noop:
          responseCode: 200
```
